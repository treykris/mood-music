# Introduction
Mood Music is built on the Spotify API. Mood Music brings a user-friendly way of matching your mood to Spotify songs.
You'll be able to find music that matches your mood, create and import Spotify playlists, and add the songs from your mood search to those playlists.


# Features
A few things that you can do on Mood Music:

- Add genres to filter your music search
- Create, import, and delete Spotify playlists
- Add songs to and delete songs from your playlists
- Move a song from one playlist to another
- Listen to a 30 second preview of a song


# Installation & Usage

## Requirements
Mood Music requires: 
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
3. [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com/) 

If you prefer to use a hosted version of MongoDB instead of downloading MongoDB locally, use [mLab](https://mlab.com/). There's a free sandbox version available for use.


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/treykris/mood-music.git
```
In the application directory run:
```
npm install 
```

## Register the Application with Spotify
Since Mood Music seeks access to a userâ€™s personal data (profile, playlists, etc.) it must be registered. Log into the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and register the application. The client ID and client secret is what will be used to authenticate our application's requests to Spotify. 

By default Mood Music uses port 5000. Copy the snippet below and add it as a Spotify Redirect URI. 
```
http://localhost:5000/user/callback/
```

Make sure to save your new Spotify settings.

**Important!** If you decide to run Mood Music on a different port have your redirect URI in your Spotify settings match the port you are running the application on.

## Client ID & Client Secret

It's recommended that you create a .env file to store your Spotify client ID and client secret. You want to keep your client secret... a secret.
You have the option of creating a .env file or using the Spotify client ID and client secret directly in server.js

#### Option 1: Creating a .env File (Recommended)
```
// .env file

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=(YOUR CLIENT ID)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=(YOUR CLIENT SECRET)

// If you're using mLab include the link to your database
MONGODB_URI=(LINK TO YOUR MLAB COLLECTION)
```

#### Option 2: Using your client ID and secret directly in server.js (Not recommended. Only for personal use)



## Import Moods to Database


If you're using mLab, see [Running Mood Music on mLab](#running-mood-music-on-mlab) to import the documents from "moods.json" into mLab.

Mood Music by default connects to a database named "moodmusic" on mongoDB. If you would like to specify the path and the name of the database Mood Music connects to either change "mongodb://localhost/moodmusic" in "server.js" or set an environment variable "MONGODB_URI" in an .env file to a path and database name of your choice. 

You have two options to import the data from "moods.json" into MongoDB. Make sure you have an instance of MongoDB running for both of the options:

#### Option: 1 - Insert JSON Data

Run the following commands in the Mongo shell
```
use moodmusic
db.moods.insertMany([ PASTE EVERYTHING INSIDE moods.json HERE ])
```

#### Option: 2 - Import JSON Data

Go to the application directory and in the command prompt run the following command:

```
mongoimport --db moodmusic --collection moods --file moods.json
```

## Running Mood Music on mLab

After signing up and creating a name for your database, create a collection named "moods".

If you have MongoDB installed locally, but decided to use mLab, go to your application directory and run the following command below in your command prompt. Replace the parentheses with your information.
```
mongoimport -h (ds012345.mlab.com:56789) -d (dbname) -c moods -u (dbuser) -p (dbpassword) --file moods.json
```
Visit [Connecting to Your Database](https://docs.mlab.com/connecting/) if you're having trouble connecting to mLab.


### For those that do not have MongoDB installed locally, you'll have to do a little more work :(. 
##### Option 1: Use the [mLab API](https://docs.mlab.com/data-api/) to insert the documents from "moods.json".

##### Option 2: Manually insert every document in the "moods.json" file into your "moods" collection.


### You're all set to run the application!
